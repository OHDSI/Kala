\title{Get Common Sequential Time Periods for Feature Extraction Reports}
\usage{
getFeatureExtractionReportCommonSequentialTimePeriods()
}
\value{
A tibble with the following columns:
  \item{timeId}{A numeric identifier for the time period.}
  \item{startDay}{The start day of the time period relative to a reference date.}
  \item{endDay}{The end day of the time period relative to a reference date.}
}
\description{
This function constructs and returns a tibble of common sequential time periods used in feature extraction reports.
The returned tibble defines prior monthly periods, post monthly periods, and a specific day period ("on day of"),
each characterized by a unique time identifier, a start day, and an end day.
}
\details{
The function defines:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Prior Monthly Periods:} A set of periods defined with start days ranging from -391 to -31,
        all ending at -1.
  \item \strong{Post Monthly Periods:} A set of periods starting on day 1 with varying end days from 1 to 361.
  \item \strong{On Day Of:} A single-day period where both the start and end day are 0.
}
These periods are combined and arranged in ascending order based on the \code{timeId} column.
