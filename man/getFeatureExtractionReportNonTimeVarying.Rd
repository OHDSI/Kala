\title{Get Non-Time-Varying Feature Extraction Report}
\usage{
getFeatureExtractionReportNonTimeVarying(
  cdmSources,
  covariateDataPath,
  cohortId,
  cohortDefinitionSet,
  remove =
    "Visit Count|Chads 2 Vasc|Demographics Index Month|Demographics Post Observation Time|Visit Concept Count|Chads 2|Demographics Prior Observation Time|Dcsi|Demographics Time In Cohort|Demographics Index Year Month"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdmSources}{An object (or list of objects) representing the Common Data Model (CDM) sources.}

\item{covariateDataPath}{A character string specifying the file path to the covariate data.}

\item{cohortId}{A numeric or character identifier for the cohort. This ID is used both to filter covariate data and
as part of the file name pattern for retrieving covariate data.}

\item{cohortDefinitionSet}{A data frame or tibble containing the cohort definition set.}

\item{remove}{A character string containing a regular expression pattern used to filter out certain covariates
from the formatted report. The default pattern removes labels related to visit counts, certain risk scores,
and demographic time metrics. Defaults to \code{'Visit Count|Chads 2 Vasc|Demographics Index Month|Demographics Post Observation Time|Visit Concept Count|Chads 2|Demographics Prior Observation Time|Dcsi|Demographics Time In Cohort|Demographics Index Year Month'}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the feature extraction report, including both the full formatted output (\code{formattedFull})
  and a filtered version (\code{formatted}) where rows matching the \code{remove} pattern in the \code{label} column have been excluded.
  If the report generation returns \code{NULL}, then \code{NULL} is returned.
}
\description{
This function generates a non-time-varying feature extraction report by calling
\code{getFeatureExtractionReportInParallel} with predefined settings and then filtering
the formatted output to remove specific covariates based on a regular expression pattern.
}
\details{
This function calls \code{getFeatureExtractionReportInParallel} with settings tailored to generate a report that
includes non-time-varying covariates. Key parameters used include:

\itemize{
  \item \code{includeNonTimeVarying = TRUE} to ensure non-time-varying covariates are included.
  \item \code{minAverageValue = 0.01} to filter out covariates with very low average values.
  \item \code{simple = TRUE} to produce a simplified report format.
  \item \code{covariateDataFileNamePattern} is set to match the cohort ID.
}

After generating the report, if a non-\code{NULL} \code{remove} pattern is provided, the function writes a message
indicating that it is removing matching labels from the formatted report, and then filters out any rows in the \code{formatted}
report whose \code{label} matches the pattern.
