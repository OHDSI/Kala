Description: The 'Kala' package provides a streamlined workflow to generate 
  and explore temporal features for cohorts in the OMOP Common Data Model. By 
  leveraging 'FeatureExtraction' and its 'temporalCovariateSettings', 'Kala' 
  produces both tabular and graphical summaries of features across configurable 
  time windows. These outputs allow easy comparisons and time-series analyses 
  for identifying patterns, trends, or changes in clinical features over time.
